## Description

In this project, I created a weather dashboard. There is a input area for the city search. When the city is inserted and the search button is clicked, the current weather information for the searched city will display, along with the five day forecast. These searches are saved to the browsers local storage, and search history buttons are created and appended to the search history area.
